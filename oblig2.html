        <p><span id="first-letter">Q</span>uestion: What's black and white and great all over? Answer: Virtually every major look out there for 
            spring/summer 2013! ... and we do mean nearly <i>EVERY</i> terrific look that came down the runway, from 
            Paris to London to Milan to New York, (we show some of the best from those runways above) not to 
            mention quite a few downunder. As we first noted last issue, nothing will beat the sharp, classic, high-definition  
            contrast of black and white in clothes and accesories this season. Beyond all the clich√©s such as 
            'opposites attract' or even 'Ebony and Ivory living in total harm-on-u', it's ageless, timeless and suddenly  
            looks so fresh, so modern, and just so <i>RIGHT</i> again after so many seasons of clashing colour and dizzying prints.  
            What's more, the options this season now stretch way beyond that predictable 'white shirt/black shirt' uniform.  
            The newsworhty looks for you to sew on these six pages (and again, we are only showing you the very tip of the  
            iceberg when it comes to the limitless possibilites) would never, ever be mistaken for a waiter's costume. In fact,  
            black and white can be applied to any look, ahywhere, anytime. What's more, the move to black and white will get  
            even stronger into winter 2014, which definitely makes it something to watch. After all, as the rest of the world  
            becomes a rather hazy, munky place, who wouldn't love at least this sort of clarity in their closet ?

        <br>
        <p>It's no accident that this dynamic duo has long ago reached classic status, as it can be the best and easiest answer 
            now to any pressing fashion question, such as how to mix prints, proportions or shapes. Wearing checks, stripes 
            <i>AND</i> spots in one outfit may sound like a one-way ticket to mess city, but the clear-cut contrast of black and white 
            effectively cleans up all that print mixing, so that it instead becomes a fun, fresh update to your casual everyday 
            basics, such as that light spring-weight trenchcoat, easy jersey t-shirt and pants on the facing page, (a slim pair of 
            white or black pants or jeans could easily replace those side-striped pants for a more classic look.)
